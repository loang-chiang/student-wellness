## Overview
Student Wellness is a website meant to raise awareness regarding the mental health of college students. It includes easily digestible data visualizations to showcase real information about the situations of actual students, as well a list of resources to help you if you're also going through similar struggles.

## Technologies Used
For the website, we used primarily HTML/CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to handle the section header animations. For the data visualizations included in the data section, the process was the following:
* We found our dataset through `Kaggle.com`
* We made the graphs using `Looker Studio`
Finally, the images used in the website are from Canva, edited to match the website's color palette.

## About The Project
This was a final project developed by students Fernanda Dantas, Rocio Echegoyemberry Ibarra, and Loang Chiang for the Kode With Klossy 2024 Data Science camp.
